---

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

1.  **Python:** Python 3.7 or higher installed.
2.  **Telegram Bot Token:**
    *   Talk to `@BotFather` on Telegram.
    *   Create a new bot using `/newbot`.
    *   Copy the **HTTP API token**.
3.  **Google Cloud Project & API Credentials:**
    *   Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    *   Create a new project or select an existing one.
    *   Enable the **Google Drive API** (APIs & Services -> Library).
    *   Create **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs** credentials (APIs & Services -> Credentials -> Create Credentials -> OAuth client ID).
    *   Select **Desktop app** as the application type.
    *   Download the credentials JSON file. Rename it to `credentials.json` and place it in the project directory.
    *   Configure the **OAuth consent screen** if prompted (User Type: External, add your Google account email as a Test User during development/testing).
4.  **(Optional) Google Drive Folder ID:**
    *   Create a folder in your Google Drive where you want files uploaded.
    *   Open the folder. The ID is the last part of the URL (e.g., `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/THIS_IS_THE_FOLDER_ID`).

## üöÄ Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/frenkiofficial/Telegram-File-to-Cloud-Bot.git
    cd Telegram-File-to-Cloud-Bot
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install python-telegram-bot==20.* google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib python-dotenv
    ```
    *(**Note:** Consider creating a `requirements.txt` file for easier dependency management)*

3.  **Place Credentials File:**
    *   Ensure the `credentials.json` file you downloaded from Google Cloud Console is in the main project directory.

4.  **Create Configuration File:**
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the project directory.
    *   Add the following lines, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:
        ```dotenv
        TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
        GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID_HERE # Optional: Leave empty to upload to root "My Drive"
        MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=100 # Optional: Set the max upload size in MB (default is 100)
        # OWNER_ID=YOUR_TELEGRAM_USER_ID # Optional: Add your Telegram User ID for potential future restricted commands
        ```

5.  **First Run & Google Authentication:**
    *   Run the bot for the first time:
        ```bash
        python telegram_gdrive_bot.py
        ```
    *   The script will attempt to authenticate with Google Drive. If `token.json` doesn't exist or is invalid, it will print a URL in your console.
    *   **Copy this URL and paste it into your web browser.**
    *   Log in with the Google account associated with the Drive you want to use.
    *   Grant the application permission to access your Google Drive files.
    *   If successful, the browser will show a confirmation, and the script will create a `token.json` file in the project directory. This file stores your authorization tokens so you don't have to authenticate via the browser every time.
    *   **Keep `token.json` secure!** Add it to your `.gitignore` file if you use Git.

6.  **Run the Bot:**
    *   After the initial authentication, you can stop the bot (Ctrl+C) and run it normally:
        ```bash
        python telegram_gdrive_bot.py
        ```
    *   The bot should now start polling for updates.
